////for loap we use for reptation for example we want to print 100 time anything you can print using loap;
for (var i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
    console.log("Hello Rao Ali Murad");
}
/////WHILE LOAP
var num = 0;
while (num <= 10) {
    console.log("hello while loap");
    num++;
}
/////DO WHILE HAS A DIFFERNET PROPERTY INDEED YOUR CONDITON IS WRONG ITS STATMENT WILL EXCUTE ONE TIME;
var num1 = 10;
do {
    console.log("hello do while loap");
} while (num1 > 20); ////conditon is wrong but it will excute one time
